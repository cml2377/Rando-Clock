# Rando-Clock
An analog clock that doesn't contain numbers. To practice reading analog, I suppose. 

## Technologies

HTML, CSS, vanilla Javascript; first time closely working with scalable vector graphics (SVG) as well.

### TIL

You can defer JS execution in the head tag. The page will load the JS file, but wait until the HTML is completely rendered before executing the JS code. No need to place script tags after the body tag in HTML.

### Acknowledgements

Practice/throwback; using LinkedIn's Javascript essential training to practice vanilla JS.
